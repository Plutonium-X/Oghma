1 - Installation
----------------

Run Setup-ThOghma.exe. If the program does not offer you to install "Quest in the service of Oghma", restart it (it is just about a problem of automatic updating of WeiDU).

2 - Contents
------------------

The mod begins in the temple of Oghma, where a new monk waits for you and offers you a small quest, which can bring you additional powers. 
Some NPCs have interjections.
